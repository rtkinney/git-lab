Answer 4: On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	READ.md
	answers.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

This shows that the two created files are not currently being tracked and need to be added to what will be committed.

Answer 5: On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   READ.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	answers.md

This now shows that one of the created files is now ready to be committed.

Answer 6: On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
